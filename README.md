# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:
For this project, we were tasked by a ride-sharing company named Pyber to analyze data from 2019 and break down the KPIs by 'city type' into easy to understand visualizations.
			ยง Key Performance Index's = Total Rides, Total Drivers, Total Fares, Average Fare per Ride, Average fare per Driver
			ยง City Type Categories = Rural, Suburban, Urban
##Results

Total Rides
 - Urban cities had significantly more rides in 2019 making up 1,625 of the 2,375 total rides.
Total Drivers
 - Urban cities also have the lion's share of active drivers in 2019, with city drivers making up 80.9% of the Pyber driver population.
Total Fares
 - Urban cities made up the majority of business for Pyber in 2019, making up $39,854.38 of the $63,538 total revenue
Average Fare per Rider
 - The avg cost of a ride is almost $10 more in urban cities compares to rural.
Average Fare per Driver
 - For 2019, the average Pyber driver in a rural area made $55.49 per driver. This is a stark contrast when compared to the $16.57 in Urban cities.
Total fare by city
 - The graph we created breaking down fare by city type across the months shows a significant increase in the number of rides on March 31st
			
## Summary
### Recommendations
Hire more drivers in Rural and Suburban areas.
- The data did not include the average duration of a trip, however assuming the average Pyber ride duration is the same across all city types, Rural and Suburban drivers are making significantly more per hour than those in Urban areas due to driver scarcity.
		
Lower the driver population in urban cities.
- If Pyber is comfortable with the driver-to-ride ratio in Rural cities, we suggest taking a look at reducing the number of drivers in cities. There are 750 more drivers than rides in Urban areas, resulting in a low avg fare per driver. This can be done by pausing the onboarding for new drivers and letting attrition reduce the number of drivers over time.
		
Lower Prices in Urban Areas
- Pyber has the opportunity to adjust their ride prices to better match demand. With urban areas having a 750 driver to ride surplus, lowering the prices would increase demand in the area to better meet supply.
